class DuckietownGraphBuilder():
    """Creates an internal g2o pose graph, and optimizes over it. At the same
       time, it keeps track of the timestamps at which messages related to an
       object (e.g. watchtower, Duckiebot) were received. We refer to objects as
       "nodes", with each node being identified by the ID of its April tag
       (node_id) and by its type (node_type). Types are defined in the class
       constructor and could e.g. be Duckiebots, watchtowers, etc.
       We instead refer to the nodes in the pose graph as "vertices".

       Attributes:
           graph: Pose graph (g2oGraphBuilder object).
           types: Possible types of nodes in the graph, i.e., of objects in
                  Duckietown.
           timestamp_local_indices:
                  Dictionary of dictionaries of dictionaries that keeps track of
                  the timestamps for each node, for each type of node. In
                  particular, a certain vertex in the graph represents an object
                  at a certain instant of time (timestamp) and is identified in
                  the internal g2o representation with a strictly integer index.
                  Since each node (i.e., object) can be seen or see another
                  node several times, multiple vertices are added to the graph
                  for the same node, with each vertex identifying the node at a
                  specific timestamp. To define the integer index that g2o needs
                  to associate to each vertex, we define an encoding (cf.
                  convert_names_to_int) based on the type of the node, the ID of
                  the node and the timestamp. Furthermore, to compress the
                  representation, for the encoding we do not use the timestamp
                  itself but rather a 'local index' that defines the order in
                  which new timestamps are associated to a node. For instance,
                  if a Duckiebot (node_type="duckie", node_id=88) first sees an
                  April tag and sends the corresponding message at timestamp t1,
                  the latter timestamp is assigned 'local index' 0 for that
                  node. If the Duckiebot is later detected by a watchtower, with
                  message sent at timestamp t2 > t1, timestamp t2 is assigned
                  'local index' 1 for the node.
                  The 'local index' given to the timestamp <time_stamp> (float)
                  w.r.t. the node with <node_id> and type <node_type> is
                  stored in
                  timestamp_local_indices[<node_type>][<node_id>][<time_stamp>].
           movable: List of the types of nodes that, for the purposes of
                    optimization, should be considered as objects that can move
                    in Duckietown (pose can be optimized).
           num_local_indices_assigned:
                    Dictionary of dictionaries.
                    num_local_indices_assigned[<node_type>][<node_id>] stores
                    the number of 'local indices' already assigned to timestamps
                    by the node of type <node_type> and with ID <node_id>.
           last_time_stamp: Dictionary of dictionaries.
                            last_time_stamp[<node_type>][<node_id>] contains the
                            timestamp latest in time among those associated to
                            the node of type <node_type> and with ID <node_id>.
           last/first_odometry_time_stamp:
                    Dictionaries of dictionaries.
                    last/first_odometry_time_stamp[<node_type>][<node_id>]
                    contains the timestamp at which the last/first odometry
                    message for the node with type <node_type> and ID <node_id>
                    was received. This information is kept track of to ensure
                    that retro-interpolation is only performed between the
                    first and the last odometry message.
           retro_interpolate: True if retro-interpolation should be performed,
                              False otherwise. Retro-interpolation allows to
                              handle messages with a timestamp anterior to the
                              latest timestamp of the already-processed
                              messages. See retrointerpolate method for further
                              details.
